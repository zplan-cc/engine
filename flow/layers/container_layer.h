/// Some ContainerLayer objects perform a rendering operation or filter on
/// the rendered output of their children. Often that operation is changed
/// slightly from frame to frame as part of an animation. During such an
/// animation, the children can be cached if they are stable to avoid having
/// to render them on every frame. Even if the children are not stable,
/// rendering them into the raster cache during a Preroll operation will save
/// an extra change of rendering surface during the Paint phase as compared
/// to using the SaveLayer that would otherwise be needed with no caching.
///
/// Typically the Flutter Widget objects that lead to the creation of these
/// layers will try to enforce only a single child Widget by their design.
/// Unfortunately, the process of turning Widgets eventually into engine
/// layers is not a 1:1 process so this layer might end up with multiple
/// child layers even if the Widget only had a single child Widget.
///
/// When such a layer goes to cache the output of its children, it will
/// need to supply a single layer to the cache mechanism since the raster
/// cache uses a layer unique_id() as part of the cache key. If this layer
/// ended up with multiple children, then it must first collect them into
/// one layer for the cache mechanism. In order to provide a single layer
/// for all of the children, this utility class will implicitly collect
/// the children into a secondary ContainerLayer called the child container.
///
/// A by-product of creating a hidden child container, though, is that the
/// child container is created new every time this layer is created with
/// different properties, such as during an animation. In that scenario,
/// it would be best to cache the single real child of this layer if it
/// is unique and if it is stable from frame to frame. To facilitate this
/// optimal caching strategy, this class implements two accessor methods
/// to be used for different purposes:
///
/// When the layer needs to recurse to perform some operation on its children,
/// it can call GetChildContainer() to return the hidden container containing
/// all of the real children.
///
/// When the layer wants to cache the rendered contents of its children, it
/// should call GetCacheableChild() for best performance. This method may
/// end up returning the same layer as GetChildContainer(), but only if the
/// conditions for optimal caching of a single child are not met.
