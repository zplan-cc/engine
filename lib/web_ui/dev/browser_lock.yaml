## Driver version in use.
## For an integration test to run, the browser's major version and the driver's
## major version should be equal. Please make sure the major version of
## the binary for `chrome` is the same with `required_driver_version`.
## (Major version meaning: For a browser that has version 13.0.5, the major
## version is 13.)
## Please refer to README's `Upgrade Browser Version` section for more details
## on how to update the version number.
required_driver_version:
  ## Make sure the major version of the binary in `browser_lock.yaml` is the
  ## same for Chrome.

chrome:
  # It seems Chrome can't always release from the same build for all operating
  # systems, so we specify per-OS build number.
  Linux: 768968 # Major version 84
  Mac: 768985 # Major version 84
  Win: 768975 # Major version 84

  # Make sure this version is the same version supported by LUCI macOS bots.
  # XCode on these bots will be updated once a year, do not forget to update
  # `heightOfHeader` during this time.

  # `xcrun simctl` command is used to take screenshots. It takes the screenshot
  # of the entire simulator. Therefore we need to crop all the parts other than
  # the browsers' content. This file must be in sync with the local and LUCI
  # versions of macOS, iOS Simulator, and Xcode.
  # `heightOfHeader` is the number of pixels taken by the phone's header menu
  # and the browsers address bar.
  # TODO: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/65672
  heightOfHeader: 282
  # `heightOfFooter` is the number of pixels taken by the phone's navigation
  # menu.
  heightOfFooter: 250
  # Most of the time tests use a portion of the screen to compare goldens
  # instead of the entire screen. This area is reprented by a rectangle
  # when taking screenshots. However the rectangle dimensions are in logical
  # coordinates. In order to convert these coordinates to coordinates on the
  # phone screeen we enlarge or shrink the area by applying a linear
  # transformation by a scale_factor (a.k.a. we perform isotropic scaling).
  # This value will be differ depending on the phone.
  scaleFactor: 1.15
