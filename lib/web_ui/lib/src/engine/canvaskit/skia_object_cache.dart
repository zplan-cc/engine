/// When using Skia, Flutter creates Skia objects which are allocated in

/// mobile, the Skia objects are wrapped by a C++ class which is destroyed
/// when the associated Dart object is garbage collected.
///
/// On the web, we cannot tell when a Dart object is garbage collected, so
/// we must use other strategies to know when to delete a Skia object. Some
/// objects, like [ui.Paint], can safely delete their associated Skia object
/// because they can always recreate the Skia object from data stored in the
/// Dart object. Other objects, like [ui.Picture], can be serialized to a
/// JS-managed data structure when they are deleted so that when the associated
/// object is garbage collected, so is the serialized data.
