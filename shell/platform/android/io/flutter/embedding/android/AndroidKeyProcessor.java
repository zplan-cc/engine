/**
 * A class to process key events from Android, passing them to the framework as messages using
 * {@link KeyEventChannel}.
 *
 * <p>A class that sends Android key events to the framework, and re-dispatches those not handled by
 * the framework.
 *
 * <p>Flutter uses asynchronous event handling to avoid blocking the UI thread, but Android requires
 * that events are handled synchronously. So, when a key event is received by Flutter, it tells
 * Android synchronously that the key has been handled so that it won't propagate to other
 * components. Flutter then uses "delayed event synthesis", where it sends the event to the
 * framework, and if the framework responds that it has not handled the event, then this class
 * synthesizes a new event to send to Android, without handling it this time.

   * <p>The view is used as the destination to send the synthesized key to. This means that the the

   *
   * <p>It is possible that that in the middle of the async round trip, the focus chain could
   * change, and instead of the native widget that was "next" when the event was fired getting the
   * event, it may be the next widget when the event is synthesized that gets it. In practice, this
   * shouldn't be a huge problem, as this is an unlikely occurance to happen without user input, and
   * it may actually be desired behavior, but it is possible.
